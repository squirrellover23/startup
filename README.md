# Startup
My plan for my startup:

I am going to make a website for my sister's job that is used as a checklist for planning events 

## Elevator pitch:
The website will allow users to sign in and see all the tasks they need to accomplish. Once they have accomplished a task they can check it off. Some admin users will also be able to create tasks for other people. There will be a couple of different pages that display different information: one page will display info on the users tasks, one page will display everyone's task, and one will display info about the upcoming events. 

## Pictures:
[Here](https://www.figma.com/proto/V7gN2ChcDAAJcxPaZQRLbd/RCL-Website?type=design&node-id=14-38&t=3qO7YGSMwwqTZn4J-0&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2) is a basic figma layout for how I want the website to look and behave. You can click the buttons to navigate between pages.

## Technologies:
Here is how I plan on using the different technologies:
HTML - I will use html as the structure for all the different pages. I will have 3 main information pages, a login page, and a few other pages.
CSS - I will use css to format the pages and to make them look good and consistant across the different pages.
JavaScript - I will use js to change how information is displayed or filter info based on user input. I will also use it to allow the user to login and check off tasks.
Service - Backend service with endpoints for:
getting tasks and event info
checking off completed tasks
DB - I will use a data base to store user data but also data on all the events and the status of the tasks
WebSocket - Use to get live updates as other people complete tasks.
authentication - users won't be able to access anything unless they login and are authorized.
